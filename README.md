# HelperApp
It's an app for people with disabilities

## Idea
I want to make this world a better place for everyone, so I decided to create an app, that will help disabled persons and their families. But the main problem is that I don't familiar with problems that one's handle. So I also added an ability to offer new features and functions.

## Stack
This app was written using **Kotlin** as main programming language, **Navigation Component** as lib for navigation, **Hilt** for dependency injection, **Retrofit** for http requests and **Azure Cognitive Services** for features like speech to text, text to speech, etc.
</br></br>
Also this app corresponds Google's best practices and clean architecture with MVVM pattern.
